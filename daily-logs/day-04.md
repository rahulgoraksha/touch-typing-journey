## Day 04 – Accuracy Stabilization & Rhythm Building

**Date:** 28 Jan 2026  
**Tool:** Monkeytype  
**Test Type:** English (30s)

### Results
- **WPM:** 34  
- **Raw WPM:** 36  
- **Accuracy:** 97.78%  
- **Consistency:** 68.97%  
- **Characters:** 85 / 1 / 0 / 0  
- **Mode:** Time (30s)

### Analysis
- Accuracy remained **excellent**, staying close to the 98% mark  
- Slight drop in WPM compared to Day 03 indicates a **more cautious typing approach**  
- Raw WPM being higher than final WPM shows **minor corrections during typing**  
- Consistency is still on the lower side, suggesting **pace fluctuations**  
- Control is strong, but rhythm breaks are limiting sustained speed  

### Next Focus
- Maintain a **steady mid-speed pace** instead of slowing down too much for accuracy  
- Focus on **even keystroke timing** rather than bursts  
- Continue 30s tests, but add **1–2 rounds of 60s tests** for rhythm endurance  
- Aim to bring consistency above **72%** while keeping accuracy ≥97%
